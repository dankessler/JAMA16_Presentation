* Introduction
#+LATEX: \stepcounter{subsection}
** Motivation
*** Pediatric Growth Charts
- Long history for height, weight, etc
*** Intrinsic Connectivity Networks
- Attention & ADHD connection
- DMN vs TPN balance
** Background
Focus today: processing pipeline, modeling, and analysis
* Methods
#+LATEX: \stepcounter{subsection}
** Sample
- Philadelphia Neurodevelopmental Cohort
- Resting state fMRI
- Penn Continuous Performance Task
- N = 519 (after QC & exclusions)
** Task: PCPT
- Penn Continuous Performance Test
- 180 trials
- 1s to respond
- "Go" on digit/letter (varies by phase)
- Measure: Acc (as %age)
** Clinical Interview
** MRI Measures
- T1-weighted image (structural contrast)
- Resting State fMRI
*** T1 Image
- Structural contrast
- Ventricles are black, "gray matter" is darker, "white matter" is brither
*** Resting state fMRI
- 4D Image (Multiple "Volumes"): X*Y*Z*time
- T2* contrast captures BOLD (blood oxygenation, coupled to neural activity)
** fMRI Prepocessing Overview
Lots of quality-control steps throughout
1. Slice-time Correction
2. Motion Correction
3. Normalization
4. Smoothing
** Preproc: Slice-time Correction

- Each fMRI volume is acquired sequentially in slices
- Volume not acquired simultaneously
- Correct (through interpolation) s.t. all slices w/in volume temporally aligned
** Prepoc: Motion Correction
- Participants move their head over the scan
- Estimate affine realignment to common volume (e.g. V_0)
- Alignment is progressive (rigid body transforms)
  - realign V_1 to V_0 using affine matrix A_1
  - align V_2 to V_0, initialize solution with A_1
  - and so on
- Store A_i
- Process A_i's to capture summary displacement information for each frame
  - this will be used later in preproccessing
** Preproc: Normalization
- Everybody's brain is unique
- This is problematic for group analyses
- Standard Brain/Space: MNI (Montreal Neurological Institute)
- Steps
  1. Rigid body registration of T1 scan to T2* scan
  2. Estimate nonlinear warp (affine + splines) b/w T1 and MNI template
  3. Apply estimated warp to each volume of T2* scan
** Preproc: Smoothing
- Normalization isn't perfect
- Brain's are plastic and diverse even when perfectly aligned anyway
- Smooth with Gaussian kernel (3D, 8mm FWHM)
** Resting Processing & Connectome Generation
*** Processing
- Linearly detrended
- COMPCor: PCA on nuisance regions (CSF & WM), regress out of GM
- Bandpass Filtering
- Motion Scrubbing: Delete volumes with large displacement/motion
*** Connectome Generation
- Isomorphic grid, 12mm spacing
- 1068 Regions of Interest (ROIs)
- Calculate pairwise correlation, then R-to-Z transform
- Vector embedding: Each participant contributes ${1068}\choose{2}$ edges
** Data Cleansing
** Independent Components Analysis
** Network Growth Charting Analyses
* Results
#+LATEX: \stepcounter{subsection}
** Network Growth Charting to Predict Task Accuracy
** Shifting DMN-TPN Architecture Among Maturing Components
** Shallow vs Lagged Dysmaturation and Task Accuracy
** Biomarker of Attention Dysfunction from Network Growth Charting
** Biomarker of ADHD from Network Growth Charting
* Discussion
#+LATEX: \stepcounter{subsection}
** Unraveling miswired connectomes
** ICN interplay
** Dysmaturation Predicts Dysfunction
** Differential Dysmaturation
* Conclusions
#+LATEX: \stepcounter{subsection}
** Conclusions
Brain network growth charting predicts attention functioning.
