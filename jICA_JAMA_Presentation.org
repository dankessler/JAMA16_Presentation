* Introduction
#+LATEX: \stepcounter{subsection}
** Motivation
*** Pediatric Growth Charts
- Long history for height, weight, etc
*** Intrinsic Connectivity Networks
- Attention & ADHD connection
- DMN vs TPN balance
** Background
Focus today: processing pipeline, modeling, and analysis
* Methods
#+LATEX: \stepcounter{subsection}
** Sample
- Philadelphia Neurodevelopmental Cohort
- Resting state fMRI
- Penn Continuous Performance Task
- N = 519 (after QC & exclusions)
** Task: PCPT
- Penn Continuous Performance Test
- 180 trials
- 1s to respond
- "Go" on digit/letter (varies by phase)
- Measure: Acc (as %age)
** Clinical Interview
** MRI Measures
- T1-weighted image (structural contrast)
- Resting State fMRI
** Standard fMRI Prepocessing
1. Slice-time Correction
2. Motion Correction
3. Normalization
4. Smoothing
** Slice-time Correction

:END:
- Each fMRI volume is acquired sequentially in slices
- Volume not acquired simultaneously
- Correct (through interpolation) s.t. all slices w/in volume temporally aligned
** Motion Correction
- Participants move their head over the scan
*** Simulation

#+END_SRC
*** Normalization
*** Smoothing

*** Preprocessing & Connectome Generation
**** Preprocessing
- Linearly detrended
- COMPCor
- Bandpass Filtering
- Motion Scrubbing
**** Connectome Generation
- Isomorphic grid
- 12mm spacing
- 
- 1068 Regions of Interest (ROIs)
*** Data Cleansing
*** Preprocessing & Connectome Generation
*** Independent Components Analysis
*** Network Growth Charting Analyses
* Results
#+LATEX: \stepcounter{subsection}
** Network Growth Charting to Predict Task Accuracy
** Shifting DMN-TPN Architecture Among Maturing Components
** Shallow vs Lagged Dysmaturation and Task Accuracy
** Biomarker of Attention Dysfunction from Network Growth Charting
** Biomarker of ADHD from Network Growth Charting
* Discussion
#+LATEX: \stepcounter{subsection}
** Unraveling miswired connectomes
** ICN interplay
** Dysmaturation Predicts Dysfunction
** Differential Dysmaturation
* Conclusions
#+LATEX: \stepcounter{subsection}
** Conclusions
Brain network growth charting predicts attention functioning.
