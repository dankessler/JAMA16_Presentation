* Introduction
#+LATEX: \stepcounter{subsection}
** Motivation
*** Pediatric Growth Charts
- Long history for height, weight, etc
*** Intrinsic Connectivity Networks
- Attention & ADHD connection
- DMN vs TPN balance
** Background
Focus today: processing pipeline, modeling, and analysis
* Methods
#+LATEX: \stepcounter{subsection}
** Sample
- Philadelphia Neurodevelopmental Cohort
- Resting state fMRI
- Penn Continuous Performance Task
- N = 519 (after QC & exclusions)
** Task: PCPT
- Penn Continuous Performance Test
- 180 trials
- 1s to respond
- "Go" on digit/letter (varies by phase)
- Measure: Acc (corrected for age with quadratic model)
** Clinical Interview
- Assesses psychopathology dimensions
- ADHD Module
- Symptom endorsement -> pseudo ADHD "diagnosis"
** MRI Measures
- T1-weighted image (structural contrast)
- Resting State fMRI
*** T1 Image
- Structural contrast
- Ventricles are black, "gray matter" is darker, "white matter" is brither
*** Resting state fMRI
- 4D Image (Multiple "Volumes"): X*Y*Z*time
- T2* contrast captures BOLD (blood oxygenation, coupled to neural activity)
** fMRI Prepocessing Overview
Lots of quality-control steps throughout
1. Slice-time Correction
2. Motion Correction
3. Normalization
4. Smoothing
** Preproc: Slice-time Correction

#+ATTR_LATEX: :width 3cm

- Each fMRI volume is acquired sequentially in slices
- Volume not acquired simultaneously
- Correct (through interpolation) s.t. all slices w/in volume temporally aligned
** Prepoc: Motion Correction
- Participants move their head over the scan
- Estimate affine realignment to common volume (e.g. V_0)
- Alignment is progressive (rigid body transforms)
  - realign V_1 to V_0 using affine matrix Q_1
  - align V_2 to V_0, initialize solution with Q_1
  - and so on
- Store Q_i
- Process Q_i's to capture summary displacement information for each frame
  - this will be used later in preproccessing
** Preproc: Normalization
- Everybody's brain is unique
- This is problematic for group analyses
- Standard Brain/Space: MNI (Montreal Neurological Institute)
- Steps
  1. Rigid body registration of T1 scan to T2* scan
  2. Estimate nonlinear warp (affine + splines) b/w T1 and MNI template
  3. Apply estimated warp to each volume of T2* scan
** Preproc: Smoothing
- Normalization isn't perfect
- Brains are plastic and diverse even when perfectly aligned anyway
- Smooth with Gaussian kernel (3D, 8mm FWHM)
** Resting Processing & Connectome Generation
*** Processing
- Linearly detrended
- COMPCor: PCA-based nuisance regression (CSF & WM)
- Bandpass Filtering (0.01 to 0.1 Hz)
- Motion Scrubbing: Delete volumes with large displacement/motion
*** Connectome Generation
- Isomorphic grid, 12mm spacing
- 1068 Regions of Interest (ROIs)
- Calculate pairwise correlation, then R-to-Z transform
- Vector embedding: Each participant contributes ${1068}\choose{2}$ edges
** Data Cleansing
- Intersubject nuisance effects may manifest at edge level
- e.g.: left handers have > connectivity at edge i
- Concatenate vector embeddings into matrix X
- estimate with OLS $X = Y\hat{\beta} + \hat{\epsilon}$
- Reestimate data as $X^{\dagger} = Y^{\dagger}\hat{\beta}$
- Y^{\dagger} is ideal design matrix where nuisance fx are flat
- Induce eigenvector selection through augmentation: add $\hat{\beta}$ for fx of interest at each edge
** Independent Components Analysis
- reduce rows of $X^{\dagger}$ through PCA ($DX$) (retain top 15 eigenvectors)
- ICA-decomposition using FastICA $X=AS$
- A: mixing matrix 15 by 15
- S: source matrix: 15 by ${1068}\choose{2}$
- Unreduce $A^{\dagger}=D^{-1}A$
- $A^{\dagger}$ is # of subjects by 15
- The i,j element indicates the expression of component j for subject i
** Network Growth Charting Analyses
- Growth charts obtained from OLS population-level estimates
- Predict each column of A with OLS $A^{\dagger}_i = age + age^2$
- Residuals from these models are *deviation scores* reflecting over- or under- expression of a component relative to age
- Use *deviation scores* to predict
  - Accuracy on PCPT (age-corrected)
  - ADHD status
* Results
#+LATEX: \stepcounter{subsection}
** Network Growth Charting to Predict Task Accuracy
- *Deviation scores* predict accuracy very well (R^2 = 0.287)
- A subset of just 6 components' *deviation scores* do most of the work (R^2 = 0.240)
- Of these, 5 show vigorous maturational profiles
- Split half analysis, OLS with all 15 *deviation scores*: R^2 = 0.176
